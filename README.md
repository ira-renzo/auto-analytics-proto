# Desktop Application for Automated Swimming Analytics
Sports analytics has become more popular in the world of sports. They play a huge role in enhancing the performance of athletes, assisting coaches in keeping track of their athletes, analyzing their performance, and determining strategies for improvement. In swimming, there have been limitations given the environment. In the Philippines, swimming analytics is limited to taking time using stopwatches, tempo trainers, and manually reviewing recorded footage by coaches for determining factors such as form and stroke count. This research aims to contribute to this issue by creating a swimming dataset focusing on the breaststroke swimming technique, which will then be used in training a pose estimation model and providing analytics, producing graphs containing phases of pull and kick motions of a swimmer performing the breaststroke.
